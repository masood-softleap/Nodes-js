Project Title: User CRUD Application with Express.js and Thunder Client

Description:

This project implements a user CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application using Node.js, Express.js, and Thunder Client for Postman testing. The application allows users to perform basic CRUD operations, including creating new users, reading existing users, updating user information, and deleting users.

Features:

- User registration and login functionality
- User profile management (create, read, update, delete)
- Validation for user input data
- Error handling for invalid requests
- Thunder Client tests for API endpoints

Technologies:

- Node.js (JavaScript runtime environment)
- Express.js (web framework for Node.js)
- Thunder Client (Postman testing tool)
- JavaScript (programming language)
- JSON (data format)

API Endpoints:

- POST /users (create new user)
- GET /users (read all users)
- GET /users/:id (read single user by ID)
- PATCH /users/:id (update single user by ID)
- DELETE /users/:id (delete single user by ID)

Thunder Client Tests:

- Test user registration and login functionality
- Test user profile management (create, read, update, delete)
- Test validation for user input data
- Test error handling for invalid requests

This project demonstrates a basic user CRUD application using Node.js, Express.js, and Thunder Client for Postman testing. It showcases a simple and scalable architecture for building RESTful APIs and performing API testing.
